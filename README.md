# Secured Web Chat based on the WebSocket technology

_Prototype_

This application implements a secured web chat using the WebSocket technology.

To use this in production you must obtain a certificate, and set the environment variables to point to the certificate, and a corresponding private key. However, you can run this locally because if the certificate is not found, a self-signed certificate will be generated.
